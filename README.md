# WordleHelper
A mini-project which helps choose the most effective guesses for https://www.powerlanguage.co.uk/wordle/

The selection of the next word simply uses the frequency with which the letters of the word appear in the english language.

The guesser does do pretty well (~4 guesses on average), but is definitely not an optimal solution. A deeper dive into information theory would be required to improve it further, so I think I'll leave the project here for now.

It was great little project!

See https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v68zYyaEmEA for a great explanation of the theory (more in-depth than I went to)
